# numberIdentification
This project implements an ANN from scratch using NumPy, with custom activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent. It processes image datasets, supports flexible architectures, and uses cross-entropy loss for classification, showcasing a complete pipeline from data loading to training and prediction without external libraries.
